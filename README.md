# Detection of Child Predators and Cyber Harassers on Social Media

## 📚 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying predatory behavior on social media platforms using supervised machine learning algorithms. The system is designed for real-time monitoring and detection with high precision.

## 🛠 Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 🧠 Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🗂️ Structure
- `data/`: Dataset for training and testing
- `models/`: Trained models (.pkl)
- `src/`: Python scripts for preprocessing and model training
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA and testing

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run preprocessing:
```
python src/preprocessing.py
```
3. Train the model:
```
python src/model_training.py
```

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high precision with Random Forest and SVM
- Real-time prediction module supports live monitoring

## 🔐 Note
This is a demo project. Be cautious when using or modifying for sensitive applications.
